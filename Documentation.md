I really like using Markdown as we don't require a "p" tag 

or a paragraph ! 

and we don't even need a "br" tag to break a line 

# Text formatting 

To make a particular **word** we just need to add two "**"  without spaces.

To make a particular *word* italicised we just need to add one "*" without spaces.

To make use of both the ***bold and italic*** we can use three "***" without spaces.


# Block quotes 

> To create a block quote we can use a ">" at the very 
>
>beginng of the text area that we want to make like this. 

Also to avoid this to happen we use ">" on each and every line 
!
> To create a block quote inside a blockquote 
>> we use ">>" this ! 

> ### We can also use other elements

> Like *this* or **this** or ***this***. 

# Lists 

### We can create ther following types of lists :
- **Ordered list**
- **Unordered List**

### Ordered List
We can create an ordered list by 

1. Using the syntax : < Number> . space 
2. Like I'm doing with this !! 
3. There is no need to use diferent numbers every time ! 
4. We can use the same number multiple times! 
5. We can create ordered list inside too 
     1. Like this by giving a "tab" space ! 
     - There is no fixed rule that inside an ordered list we need to write only ordered lists, we can use unordered lists too ! 

### Unordered List 

We can create an Unordered list by 
- Using the following syntax : < - > space 
- There are many symbols to use such as :
    + A Plus sign + 
    * An Asterisk sign *
    - Or A Dash sign
